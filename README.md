- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

3 Apps: 
- Instagram
  - I like the posting feature, it alows users to express themselves and connect with others on their timeline
  - I like the dming features, it allows users to be able to share funny content
- TikTok
  - I like the scrolling features, it is immersive and enables users t oscroll for hours without getting bored
  - I like the shopping feature, it allows users to buy things they would never have had access to without Tiktok shop
- Pinterest
  - I like hte ability to create colalges of media that serve as inspiration for creative bodies of work
  - I like the ability to share and keep up with your favorite creators
 
What would I make? 
- I would make another application that can provide a platform to share bodies of content to an audience. A social media app! I would ensure that users are able to message each other. I would also ensure
- that users can prefer my app over others because of its immerisve user experience and elements that make it unique among competition. I would like to implement a pinterest inspired app that
- would also be able to serve as a collection of works pieced together to inspire somethign new. Profiles would consist of collages of posts, similar to the way pitnerest has several boards to a
- profile and several pins to a board. I would like to take inspiratio nfrom TIktok's scrolling mechanisms and Instagrams classic posting.
